# Stock Management Project

This is the first project I made in CodeClan, after four weeks of learning on Ruby, Sinatra framework and PSQL. I had 5 days to create an app for a book shop to manage their inventory, the app should be able to add/edit books and publishers to inventory list.

## Project Brief

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem


### Application Set up


Run the App

```
ruby app.db
```

Populate the database
```
ruby db/seeds.db
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
